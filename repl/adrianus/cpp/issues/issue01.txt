issue with referencing "special hardcoded methods" in recursive member accesses
!!! a potential fix would be to have create_server encapsulated in an intermediate entity like just: "PlainSocket" or just "Socket"

this.socket.create_server
^       ^         ^
|       |         |
this is just this from the containing class
        |         |
        a socket object within the class
                  |
                  this is "create_server" from evaluator, it's not a normal method (accessible through recursive member access)
