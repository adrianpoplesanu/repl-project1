Python implementation of Ad

this implementation is used for prototyping
once features are implemented here, they are developed in cpp and java

The way the vm works:
- parse the program, create the ast nodes
- instructions is a list of bytes representing instructions
- bytecode is comprised of instructions and constants
- the compiler parses the tree of ast nodes just like the evaluator did, recursive parsing through nodes
- compiler.emit generates the bytes which act as instructions
- the emitting is done via code.make
- the vm runs the bytecode generated by the compiler(the bytecode contains instructions and constants)
